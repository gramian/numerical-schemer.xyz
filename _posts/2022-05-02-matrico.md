# `matrico` 0.1 Release and "Numerical Schemer" Kick-Off

This is the development blog accompanying `matrico`.
So, what is `matrico`?
`matrico` is a [CHICKEN Scheme](http://call-cc.org) egg providing a flonum matrix module,
and hence enabling numerical computation.
Let's analyze the previous statement for proper understanding:

1. "CHICKEN Scheme" is an R5RS Scheme implementation.
2. An "egg" is an extension package (format) for CHICKEN Scheme.
3. "flonum" is Scheme-speak for floating-point number.
4. A "matrix" is a two-dimensional array.
5. Numerical computation means calculation with finite-precision numbers, ie flonums.

Finally, floating-point matrix computations are the basis for modern numerical mathematics.

Now, this blog will explain the technical, programming, algorithmic, numerical,
and mathematical details of this module, as well as why Scheme, particularly CHICKEN Scheme, was chosen.
Overall, the goal of this blog is to demonstrate numerics in Scheme, to train **Numerical Schemers**.

Back to `matrico`: the initial version 0.1 has been released.
The repository is located at:

[https://github.com/gramian/matrico](github.com/gramian/matrico)

The function reference can be found at:

[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/matrico](wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/matrico)

As `matrico` is listed in the official CHICKEN Scheme egg repository,
it can be installed by:
```
chicken-install matrico
```
